# DS210-Final-Project
Submission for BU DS210 Final Project

The dataset used for this project was taken from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. The dataset contains information about social circles on Facebook, with approximately 4000 nodes and 80000 edges. The file can be accessed through Stanford's SNAP webpage or by following the link below and downloading the file marked facebook_combined.txt:

https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html

NOTE: in order for the code to run properly, an extra line must be added to the beginning of facebook_combined.txt that contains only the number "4039." Without this, the code will not know how long to run and will result in parsing errors.
